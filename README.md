# What is React Query?

## Introduction and Advantages

React Query, also known as TanStack Query, is a library for fetching data from a server.

Its main advantages are that it retrieves data in an optimized and fast way; it also caches queries, and synchronizes/updates server data very simply.

It can be used with both Fetch API and Axios.

## Terms in React Query

React Query introduces a lot of new concepts, but there are two that are the most important:

- **Queries:** Used to fetch data from a server or API (GET)
- **Mutations:** Used to create/update/delete data on the server (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
